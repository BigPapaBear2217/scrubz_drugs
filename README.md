**Note**
I have rewritten some of the code. Hopefully it shouldn't be super heavy for clients. I have attempted to get it to run as close to 0.01ms as possible. I'm still a pepega, so if something can be written better/something is written wrong/you can optimize it better, please do so and make a pull request or just shoot me a message on discord: Scrubz#0001

------ Bugs ------
I already know you are able to sell to the locals inside various shops around the city. I'm just lazy and haven't gone to each one to grab coords and add checks to disable being able to sell drugs in the stores.

Still too lazy to fix this^^ LOL
